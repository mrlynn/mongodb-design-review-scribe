# ðŸŽ­ Test Speaker Detection Formatting

## To see how speaker detection looks when working:

1. **Enable Speaker Detection** in settings (âœ… you've done this)

2. **Start recording** and speak a few words

3. **Stop recording**

4. **Manually edit the transcript** to add speaker labels:
   - Go to the Transcript tab
   - Replace your transcript text with this test data:

```
Speaker 1: Hello, welcome to today's meeting.
Speaker 1: We're going to discuss the quarterly budget.
Speaker 2: I think we should increase marketing spend by 20%.
Speaker 1: That sounds like a good idea to me.
Speaker 3: Let's also talk about hiring new developers.
Speaker 2: How many developers are we thinking of hiring?
Speaker 1: I'd say we need at least two senior developers.
Speaker 3: And maybe one junior developer for mentoring.
```

## Expected Result:
You should see:
- **Green chip** "Speaker 1" for first speaker
- **Blue chip** "Speaker 2" for second speaker  
- **Orange chip** "Speaker 3" for third speaker
- Proper text formatting with colored speaker indicators

## What This Proves:
- âœ… Speaker detection UI is implemented
- âœ… Settings integration works
- âœ… Visual indicators work
- âœ… Transcript formatting works
- âœ… Only missing: actual diarization models

## Next Steps:
1. **Download diarization models** (if you want real speaker detection)
2. **Or keep current setup** (works with fallback to standard transcription)
3. **Generate reports** - they will include speaker information when available
