# Bitscribe Distribution Ready

## ✅ All Critical Issues Fixed

The app is now ready for distribution with the following issues resolved:

### 🔧 Fixed Issues

1. **✅ Data Directory**: Now uses `app.getPath('userData')` instead of trying to write to app.asar
2. **✅ Config Storage**: Uses proper app data directory instead of hardcoded `.research-companion`
3. **✅ Whisper Binaries**: Automatically finds binaries in both development and production paths
4. **✅ Binary Permissions**: AfterPack script sets executable permissions on macOS/Linux
5. **✅ Debug Code**: Debug modules only load in development mode
6. **✅ First Run Setup**: Shows welcome dialog on first launch
7. **✅ Production Build**: Proper NODE_ENV=production builds with optimizations

### 🚀 Ready Distribution Files

Built files are in `dist/` directory:
- `bitscribe-1.0.0.dmg` (Intel Mac)
- `bitscribe-1.0.0-arm64.dmg` (Apple Silicon Mac)
- `bitscribe-1.0.0-mac.zip` (Intel Mac Archive)
- `bitscribe-1.0.0-arm64-mac.zip` (Apple Silicon Archive)

### 📦 Build Commands

```bash
# Production build for macOS
npm run dist:mac

# Production build for Windows
npm run dist:win

# Production build for Linux
npm run dist:linux

# All platforms
npm run dist
```

### 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [x] App starts without errors
- [x] Data directories created in proper locations
- [x] Whisper binaries are executable
- [x] Config persists between sessions
- [x] First run experience works
- [x] No debug noise in production
- [x] Files install correctly from DMG

### 📁 App Data Locations

**macOS:**
- Config: `~/Library/Application Support/bitscribe/config.json`
- Sessions: `~/Library/Application Support/bitscribe/sessions/`

**Windows:**
- Config: `%APPDATA%\bitscribe\config.json`
- Sessions: `%APPDATA%\bitscribe\sessions\`

**Linux:**
- Config: `~/.config/bitscribe/config.json`
- Sessions: `~/.config/bitscribe/sessions/`

### 🔐 Security Notes

- API keys stored in config file (recommend encryption for future versions)
- App is code-signed with Apple Developer certificate
- No sensitive data in logs in production mode

### 📋 Manual Testing Steps

1. Install from DMG on clean system
2. Launch app - should show welcome dialog
3. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
4. Test transcription with built-in microphone
5. Verify research appears in Research tab
6. Restart app - config should persist
7. Check that sessions are saved properly

### 🚨 Known Limitations

- Requires manual microphone permission grant
- Whisper model downloads are not automated (future enhancement)
- No automatic updates (future enhancement)

## Distribution Ready! 🎉

The app is now production-ready and can be distributed via:
- Direct DMG download
- Mac App Store (with additional setup)
- Enterprise distribution
- GitHub releases
